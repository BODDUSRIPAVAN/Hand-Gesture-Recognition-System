Hand gesture recognition is a challenging but important problem in computer vision.
It has a wide range of applications, such as controlling devices, interacting with virtual reality environments, and providing input for 
sign language recognition systems. This project will develop a hand gesture recognition system using a deep learning approach.
The system will be trained on a dataset of hand gesture images and videos. The system will then be able to recognize a variety of hand gestures,
including simple gestures such as pointing and waving, as well as more complex gestures such as signing letters and numbers. The system will be
evaluated on a held-out test set of hand gesture images and videos. The evaluation will measure the accuracy of the system in recognizing 
different hand gestures. The project will also explore the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the system.
Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset. This can help to improve the
generalization performance of the system and reduce the risk of overfitting. The results of this project will contribute to the development of
more robust and accurate hand gesture recognition systems. The system will be made available to the public so that it can be used by 
researchers and developers to build new applications.
